Rough meaning of structures used
---
O: "off-line mode" settings 
P: pre-calculation settings
Q: Qsmr settings  
R: repository for internal variables


For operational "start-up" see test.m!

For test "start-up" do:
---
R = q2_init;
R0.WORK_FOLDER = Q.WORK_AREA;  

For automatic check of Q, do
---
Q = q_std;    
q2_check_q( Q, R0 );
