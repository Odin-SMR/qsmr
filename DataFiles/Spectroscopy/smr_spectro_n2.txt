N2 continuum absorption is based om MPM93, but scaled with a factor of 1.34. 
THe notes from the continua files are:

# the reference for the scaling factor of 1.34 is:
# J. Boissoles et al.
# Theoretical calculation of the translation-rotation collision-induced
# absorption in N2-N2, O2-O2, and N2-O2 pairs
# JQSRT, vol. 82 (2003) 505-516.
# For the Odin frequencies it is sufficient to use this constant
# scaling factor and not the frequency dependent factors given in the paper.
# The scaling incluses CIA contributions from O2-O2 and N2-O2 besides
# the original N2-N2 CIA.
# One has to note that Boissoles et al. used their own N2-N2- CIa model
# and not the B&F model to deduce this scaling factors. However, for the
# Odin frequencies the difference between these two models should be
# very small, implying that the 1.34 scaling factor is also appropriate
# in connection with the B&F model within the uncertainty range.
