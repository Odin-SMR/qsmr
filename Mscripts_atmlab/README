This folder contains all functions copied from Atmlab.

Note that the full atmlab/arts/xml atmlab/time folders are copied.

Please note that some functions are slightly modified. These are the main
changes

* All dependency of Atmlab's constants function is removed.
* Input checks are removed in some functions.
* Some (not used) parts of arts_sx have been removed
* Screen width and verbosity (for oem) hard-coded in out.m.

That is, don't just copy functions back to Atmlab. If some improvement shall be
introduced in Atmlab, just copy the lines of code changed.
